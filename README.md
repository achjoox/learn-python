****Learning Python****

*experimental. all module's from GPT. Can we solve and learn using GPT?*

Hi! i'm Jack and i'm interested in AI and python for backend. 
Right now, i'm focusing on python and step up to PyTorch / TensorFlow for developing ChatBot.
All reference are from GPT. I was challenging myself to learn from one base GPT. Can we solve it or not?
